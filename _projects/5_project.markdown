We found in silico that FABP6 could be a new colon adenocarcinoma cancer biomarker using the TCGA COAD cohort and that the drug Abemaciclib characteristic affinity for the different protein structure of the gene. Our work using machine learning and molecular docking is <a href="https://lnkd.in/dxsq2nc">here</a>. We observed four interactions of interest: GLTP-Nilotinib, PTPRN-Venetoclax, VEGFA-Venetoclax and FABP6-Abemaciclib. The FABP6 gene and its role within different metabolic pathways were studied and we observed the capability of the FABP6 gene to be a therapeutic target. Our in silico results showed a significant specificity of the union of the protein products of the FABP6 gene as well as the known action of Abemaciclib as an inhibitor of the CDK4/6 protein and therefore, of the cell cycle. In this context, we can conclude that FABP6 is a specific biomarker for COAD and READ, so the action of an inhibitory mechanism could lead to positive results in slowing down the growth of the tumor. FABP6 is an early diagnostic biomarker, which would greatly assist the various possible treatments of this type of cancer.
