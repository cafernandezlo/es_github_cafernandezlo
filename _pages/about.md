Assistant Professor and vice dean of computing resources of the Faculty of Computer Science at the 
University of A Coruña (UDC). I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2014 
from UDC and in 2020 a MSc in Bioinformatics from the Open University of Catalonia and the University 
of Barcelona. During my PhD, I was also a visiting student at the University of Parma 
(supervisor: Dr. Stefano Cagnoni) and University of Bristol (supervisor: Dr. Colin Campbell). 
Before joining the UDC in 2018, I held a Juan de la Cierva - Formación (FJCI-2015-26071), a highly 
competitive research grant with a 13.46% success rate (in the Computer Science and Information 
Technology call) at the Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña. During this fellowship, I was 
also a visiting scholar at the Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Christina Curtis. 

I have participated in (10) research projects, some with journal publications indexed in the WOS 
(JCR) where I partipated mainly as the first author: CIMED (11), REGICC (6), 2DGel (9). 
Additionally, I have established strong and active international collaborations and I am a 
well-established researcher in the area, due to this, I led two special issues as guest editor 
in JCR journals with <a href="https://publons.com/researcher/1751450/carlos-fernandez-lozano/">{{site.publons_number_editor}}</a> 
verified editor records. 

I have published (**{{site.total_jcr}}**) research papers in JCR-ranked journals (**{{site.total_q1}}**-Q1,
 **{{site.total_d1}}**-D1 and {{site.total_q2}}-Q2), ({{site.total_fa}}) as first author,
 ({{site.total_ca}}) as corresponding author and (**{{site.total_sa}}**) as senior author, (8) including conferences and book chapters, with an 
accumulated IF of ({{site.total_if}}). Including high-impact journals: Nature Communications, 
Scientific Reports, Genetic Selection Evolution or Journal of Cheminformatics. 

My research work has 
<a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=gE-7NE4AAAAJ&hl=es">{{site.scholar_number_cites}}</a> citations up to now, reporting and h-index of {{site.scholar_hindex}} (source: Google Scholar). 
I have reviewed 
<a href="https://publons.com/researcher/1751450/carlos-fernandez-lozano/">{{site.publons_number_reviews}}</a> 
manuscripts in JCR-indexed journals (source: Publons) and I have been member of (2) Ph.D. thesis committes. 

Academic Editor - PeerJ Computer Science Journal, Editorial Board Member - BMC Molecular and Cell Biology, Topic Board Editor - Entropy.

My research line have been focused on cutting-edge, model-based, multidisciplinary research where the 
overarching goal is to foster research that connects computer science, bioinformatics and engineering. 
Particularly, I have developed applications within the convergence between biology and 
Machine Learning, following a data-driven approach for data integration in the analysis of complex 
relationships.
