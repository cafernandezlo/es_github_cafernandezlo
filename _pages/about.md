Associate Professor (Profesor Titular de Universidad) and vice-dean of computing resources of the Faculty of Computer Science at the 
University of A Coruña (UDC), Department of Computer Science and Information Technologies. Affiliated Researcher at the Centre for Information and Communications Technology Research (CITIC) and 
the Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña (INIBIC).

I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2014 
from UDC and in 2020 a MSc in Bioinformatics from the Open University of Catalonia and the University 
of Barcelona. During my PhD, I was also a visiting student at the University of Parma 
(supervisor: Dr. Stefano Cagnoni) and University of Bristol (supervisor: Dr. Colin Campbell). 
Before joining the UDC in 2018, I held a Juan de la Cierva - Formación (FJCI-2015-26071), a highly 
competitive research grant with a 13.46% success rate (in the Computer Science and Information 
Technology call) at the Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña (INIBIC). During this fellowship, I was 
also a visiting scholar at the Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Christina Curtis. 

Current research lines include the conception and development of multi-omic data integration strategies with special focus on genome, 
transcriptome and metagenome data to monitor complex and multifactorial diseases. Hence, I am committed to 
build a research program on how biological interactions are manifested at the disease level through the use, development 
and application of kernel-based integrative computational approaches.
