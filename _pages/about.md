Associate Professor (Profesor Titular de Universidad) and vice-dean of computing resources of the Faculty of Computer Science at the 
University of A Coruña (UDC), Department of Computer Science and Information Technologies. Affiliated Researcher at the Centre for Information and Communications Technology Research (CITIC) and 
the Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña (INIBIC).

I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2014 
from UDC and in 2020 a MSc in Bioinformatics from the Open University of Catalonia and the University 
of Barcelona. During my PhD, I was also a visiting student at the University of Parma 
(supervisor: Dr. Stefano Cagnoni) and University of Bristol (supervisor: Dr. Colin Campbell). 
Before joining the UDC in 2018, I held a Juan de la Cierva - Formación (FJCI-2015-26071), a highly 
competitive research grant with a 13.46% success rate (in the Computer Science and Information 
Technology call) at the Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña (INIBIC). During this fellowship, I was 
also a visiting scholar at the Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Christina Curtis. 

After my 4-year postdoc at the INIBIC, I currently hold an appointment at UDC and I was recognized 
with a 5-years period (2016-2021) on teaching work and a 6-years period (2011-2016) on reseach work (ANECA-CNEAI).
I am currently supervising several PhD students, one of them being in her final year dealing with biologically active compounds in colon 
cancer and two of whom are in the middle of their studies dealing with microbiome data integration and genomic mapping of 
antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. The number of authors per article signing as senior author does not exceed four 
people (~4.6 average per paper). Additionally, I have established strong and active international collaborations (only 12 out of 
{% bibliography_count -f papers --query @article[year<={{2022}} ] %} 
publications with my PhD supervisors). 

I have published (**{% bibliography_count -f papers --query @article[year<={{2022}} ] %}**) research papers in JCR-ranked journals (**{{site.total_q1}}**-Q1,
 **{{site.total_d1}}**-D1 and {{site.total_q1q2}}% Q1-Q2), ({{site.total_fa}}) as first author,
 ({{site.total_ca}}) as corresponding author and (**{{site.total_sa}}**) as senior author - 9 including conferences ({% bibliography_count -f conferences --query @inproceedings[year<={{2022}} ] %}) and 
book chapters ({% bibliography_count -f bookchapter --query @inbook[year<={{2022}} ] %}) - with an 
accumulated IF of ({{site.total_if}}). Including high-impact journals: Nature Communications, Expert Systems with Applications, Neuroinformatics,
Scientific Reports, Genetics Selection Evolution, Trends in Analytical Chemistry or Journal of Cheminformatics. 

My research work has 
<a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=gE-7NE4AAAAJ&hl=es">{{site.scholar_number_cites}}</a> citations up to now, reporting and h-index of {{site.scholar_hindex}} (source: Google Scholar). 
I have reviewed 
<a href="https://publons.com/researcher/1751450/carlos-fernandez-lozano/">{{site.publons_number_reviews}}</a> 
manuscripts in JCR-indexed journals (source: Publons) and I have been member of (4) Ph.D. thesis committes. 

Current research lines include the conception and development of multi-omic data integration strategies with special focus on genome, 
transcriptome and metagenome data to monitor complex and multifactorial diseases. Hence, I am committed to 
build a research program on how biological interactions are manifested at the disease level through the use, development 
and application of kernel-based integrative computational approaches.
