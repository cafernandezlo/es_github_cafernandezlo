Assistant Professor at the University of A Coruña (UDC). I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2014 
from UDC and in 2020 a MSc in Bioinformatics from the Open University of Catalonia and the University 
of Barcelona. During my PhD, I was also a visiting student at the University of Parma (supervisor: Dr. 
Stefano Cagnoni) and University of Bristol (supervisor: Dr. Colin Campbell). Before joining the UDC in 
2018, I held a Juan de la Cierva - Formación (FJCI-2015-26071), a highly competitive research grant 
with a 13.46% success rate (in the Computer Science and Information Technology call) at the Institute 
of Biomedical Research of A Coruña. During this fellowship, I was also a visiting scholar at the 
Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Christina Curtis. 

I have participated in (10) research projects, some with journal publications indexed in the WOS (JCR) 
where I partipated mainly as the first author: CIMED (11), REGICC (6), 2DGel (9). Additionally, I have 
established strong and active international collaborations and I am a well-established researcher in 
the area, due to this, I led two special issues as guest editor in JCR journals with 
<a href="https://publons.com/researcher/1751450/carlos-fernandez-lozano/">{{site.number_editor}}</a> 
verified editor records (last updated {{site.last_updated}}): <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy/special_issues/high_dimensional">Entropy</a> and <a href="http://www.aimspress.com/newsinfo/1364.html">Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering</a>. 
I have published (32) research papers in JCR-ranked journals (17-Q1, 8-D1 and 11-Q2), (15) as first 
author, (12) as corresponding author and (19) without my thesis supervisors, (3) of them without 
authors of my own institution and finally, (2) as senior author. Including high-impact journals: 
Nature Communications, Scientific Reports, Genetic Selection Evolution or Journal of Cheminformatics. 
My research work has <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=gE-7NE4AAAAJ&hl=es">{{site.number_cites}}</a> citations up to now, reporting and h-index of {{site.hindex}} (source: Google Scholar, last updated: {{site.last_updated}}). 
Currently, supervisor of (2) PhD students (5 publications as senior author) and I have supervised (2) 
Master students and (11) Bachelor students. I have reviewed <a href="https://publons.com/researcher/1751450/carlos-fernandez-lozano/">{{site.number_reviews}}</a> 
manuscripts in JCR-indexed journals (source: Publons, last updated: {{site.last_updated}}). 

My research line have been focused on cutting-edge, model-based, multidisciplinary research where the 
overarching goal is to foster research that connects computer science, bioinformatics and engineering. 
Particularly, I have developed applications within the convergence between biology and 
Machine Learning, following a data-driven approach for data integration in the analysis of complex 
relationships.
