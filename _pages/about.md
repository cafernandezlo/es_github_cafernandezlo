Assistant Professor at the University of A Coruña (UDC). I obtained my PhD in computer science in 2014 from UDC and in 2020 a MSc in Bioinformatics from the Open University of Catalonia and University of Barcelona. During my PhD, I was also a visiting student at the University of Parma (supervisor: Dr. Stefano Cagnoni) and University of Bristol (supervisor: Dr. Colin Campbell). Before joining the UDC in 2018, I held a Juan de la Cierva - Formación (FJCI-2015-26071) at the Institute of Biomedical Research of A Coruña. During this fellowship, I was also a visiting scholar at the Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Christina Curtis. 

I have participated in (9) research projects. Additionally, I have established strong and active international collaborations and I am a well-established researcher in the area, due to this, I led two special issues as guest editor in JCR journals: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy/special_issues/high_dimensional">Entropy</a> and <a href="http://www.aimspress.com/newsinfo/1364.html">Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering</a>. I have published (30) research papers in JCR-ranked journals (16-Q1, 7-D1 and 10-Q2), (14) as first author, (11) as corresponding author and (17) without my thesis supervisors, (3) of them without authors of my own institution. Including high-impact journals: Nature Communications, Scientific Reports, Genetic Selection Evolution or Journal of Cheminformatics. My research work has <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=gE-7NE4AAAAJ&hl=es">citations</a> up to now, reporting and h-index of (12). Currently, supervisor of (2) PhD students (4 publications as senior author) and I have supervised (2) Master students and (10) Bachelor students. I have reviewed <a href="https://publons.com/researcher/1751450/carlos-fernandez-lozano/">papers</a> in JCR-indexed journals. 

My research line have been focused on cutting-edge, model-based, multidisciplinary research where the overarching goal is to foster research that connects computer science, bioinformatics and engineering. Particularly, I have developed applications within the convergence between biology and Machine Learning, following a data-driven approach for data integration in the analysis of complex relationships.
